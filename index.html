      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been working for 12 years 
        in financial services working on just about everything 
        except software development. The opportunities that I 
        have had to perform some software development have peaked
        my interest and I want to know more.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am a Colorado Native living in Denver most of my
        life. Outside of Colorado, I have lived in Spokane,
        WA and Edinburgh, Scotland. 
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are spending time with my new
        husband, John, and my adorable dog, Albert. We enjoy
        hiking, camping, and roadtripping. When I get a chance,
        I am an avid Rockies fan and enjoy watching most sports,
        in general.        
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job consists of problem solving, working on 
        something valuable and tangible, and working in a appreciative
        work environment. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live at the base of North Table Mountain in Golden, CO.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In my career, the opportunities that I have had to 
        program or develop any software tools have been the best part
        of each job. So, I am looking to maximize the skills that 
        will bring me the most joy.
